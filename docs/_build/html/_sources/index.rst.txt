**************
Overview
**************

This programme solves the one dimensional time-independent schrodinger equation for a given
potential numerically. It is designed to interpolate a given potential and retrieve
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors via discredization and solving the eigenvalue
problem in matrix form. After solving for the energies, wavefuctions and standard
deviation the program will display the results in a plot giving the option to
save the plot.

******************
Input
******************

In order for the solver to solve the potential it is necessary to place a file called
**schrodinger.inp** in the root folder of the programme.
The input file must have to following format (example):

::

	4.0            # Mass
	-5.0 5.0 1999  # xMin xMax nPoint
	1 5            # first and last eigenvalue to include in the output
	polynomial     # interpolation type
	3              # # nr. of interpolation points and xy declarations
	-1.0  0.5
	0.0  0.0
	1.0  0.5

The options for the interpolation types are **linear** for linear, **csplines** for cubic csplines
and **polynomial** for polynomial interpolation.
Al the other values can be configured to your liking. When choosing the number
of interpolation points, make sure that those and the number coordinates
below match.

******
Output
******

The programme will save the files **eigenvalues.dat**, **expvalues.dat**, **potential.dat** and
**wavefuncs.dat** in a folder called *output/*.

The file **eigenvalues.dat** will give the amount of requested eingenvalues and will look like this:

::

	eigenvalue-1
	eigenvalue-2
	:
	:
	eigenvalue-n

The file **expvalues.dat** will give the expected values and the standard deviation and
will look like this:

::

	expvalue-1 standarddev-1
	expvalue-2 standarddev-2
	:          :
	expvalue-n standarddev-n


The file **potential.dat** will give the interpolated and discretiziced potential with its
x- and y-values and will look like this:

::

	potential-x1 potential-y1
	potential-x2 potential-y2
	:           :
	potential-xn potential-yn


The file **wavefuncs.dat** will give the x- and y-values to the according wave functions.
This file will look like this:

::

	wavef-x1 wavefunc-1-y1 wavefunc-2-y1 ....   wavefunc-n-y1
	wavef-x1 wavefunc-1-y2 wavefunc-2-y2 ....   wavefunc-n-y2
	:       :           :                  :
	wavef-x1 wavefunc-1-yn wavefunc-2-yn ....   wavefunc-n-yn

The plot of the given files will automatically appear on your screen.


********************
Starting the program
********************

To start the programme simply create the file *schrodinger.inp*
and start **index.py**. If this:

::

  Cannot find file schrodinger.inp. Please input file location:

appears in the console please specify the location of the input file.
